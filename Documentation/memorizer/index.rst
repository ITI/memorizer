Memorizer
=========

Memorizer is a tool to track all the allocs, accesses and frees for
every object inside the kernel and output them as a CAPMAP, to be used
for further analysis.

This is intended to be a comprehensive guide to get you started with the
Memorizer project. It is intended to be a reference for anyone working
on the project, and should contain the information needed to boot-up and
run the memorizer kernel, along with collecting and sending kmap data.
